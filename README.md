# NobleFates-MoreStoned
Ups the scaling for stone via gathered (requires new game)
Small gatherable stones go up to (around) 62.
I've added scaling, so the bigger stone chunks give more per size (the ones you pickaxe).

The more stone it gives, the more health it will have and there doesn't seem to be a way to change it.
